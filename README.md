# 🎓 Student Management System

A **Tkinter-based Student Management System** built with Python to manage student records, track attendance, calculate marks, and generate report cards. This project provides an easy-to-use interface with an attractive design for managing academic data efficiently.



## 📖 About Project

The Student Management System is a Python-based desktop application developed using Tkinter. It provides a structured and user-friendly way to manage student information such as personal details, course enrollment, subject-wise marks, and attendance records.

The system also includes automated report card generation and attendance validation (students with less than 75% attendance are not eligible for exams). This project demonstrates the use of Python’s object handling, GUI design, and data validation techniques in a real-world educational setting.


## 🚀 Features

* ➕ **Add Students** – Store ID, name, course, subject-wise marks, and attendance.
* 👀 **View All Students** – Display all student records in a user-friendly format.
* 🔍 **Search Students** – Quickly find students by their ID or name.
* ✏️ **Update Student Info** – Edit existing student details.
* ❌ **Delete Students** – Remove student records safely.
* 📄 **Generate Report Card** – Includes marks and attendance check (students with <75% attendance cannot write exams).
* 🎨 **Attractive UI** – Styled with Tkinter widgets, light blue background, and modern button design.



## ❓ Why This Project

Managing student records manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This project was developed to provide an efficient, reliable, and simple digital solution.

It can be used by schools, colleges, and training institutes to maintain academic data in an organized manner. Additionally, it serves as a great learning project for Python beginners to practice GUI programming, modular coding, and software design patterns.


## ▶️ How to Use

1. Launch the application by running:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Use the main menu options to:

   * Add new students by entering details step by step.
   * View all saved student records.
   * Search, update, or delete specific student data.
   * Generate a report card to see marks and attendance eligibility.

3. Exit the application anytime with the **Exit Application** button.



## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Export student data to Excel/CSV.
* Add database integration (SQLite/MySQL).
* Add authentication system for admin access.
